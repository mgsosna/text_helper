# text_helper: a TL;DR for your text
Tired of reading an entire string, text file, or webpage? Well, look no further: this repo has got you covered. From the convenience of your command line, we'll use NLP to extract those insights you've been itching to know: the number of words and sentences, the most common words, etc. Stick around to see the functions in this repo grow more nuanced and numerous.

## `str_report`
From the command line, input a string to get a quick report. For example: <br>
`python str_report.py "Hello! My name is Matt and I love NLP."`
