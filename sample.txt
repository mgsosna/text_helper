Day 1: I made it to Mars! It is amazing to be here. Time to dig in and see what we can find...
Day 5: A sandstorm has knocked out communications. The Martian weather is pretty intense. Hopefully we can get the satellite array back online soon. Mining operations are continuing as normal.
Day 12: Haven't been able to turn the communications array back on. That's ok, I'm sure I'll fix it soon.
Day 29: I might be going crazy. Mineral extraction going as planned, but sometimes the wind makes strange, almost voice-like sounds...
Day ??: I've decided to become a Martian. It's a career pivot, I know. But we have to challenge ourselves sometime. Signing out!
